<h1> Hi! My name is Lekha. </h1>
<br>
<body> I'm a sophomore from Colorado majoring in Information Science and Data Science. 
  I've been interested in project management since I took on the role of production chair for my competitive dance team, Illini Raas. I'm a part of
Illinois Business Consulting, where I'm excited to put my project management skills I learn from this course to good use. </body>
